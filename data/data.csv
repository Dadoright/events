There will be a talk every day from 16:00-18:00 CEST from July 26 to August 13. We will start with a primer week to learn the very basics of continuous optimization (July 26 - July 30), followed by two weeks of talks by the speakers on more advanced continuous optimization and its use in graph algorithms (August 2 - 13) The event will take place entirely online and there is no cost for registration.This summer school's scope is international, and its goal is to bring together leading researchers with international participants of graduate level and above. </p>""","""researchtalk"""
